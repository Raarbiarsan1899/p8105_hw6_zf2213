### Problem 1

``` r
# read data from github repo
homicide_raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
    # create city_state variable
    unite(col = "city_state", city:state, sep = ", ", remove = FALSE) %>% 
    mutate(solved = "Closed by arrest" %in% disposition) %>% 
    filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX",
                                                         "Phoenix, AZ",
                                                         "Kansas City, MO",
                                                         "Tulsa, AL"))) %>%
    mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
                 victim_race = if_else(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white"))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

    ## Warning in evalq(as.numeric(victim_age), <environment>): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion
