### Problem 1


```{r}
# read data from github repo
homicide <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
	# create city_state variable
	unite(col = "city_state", city:state, sep = ", ", remove = FALSE) %>% 
	# create a variable for resolved
	mutate(resolved = disposition %in% "Closed by arrest") %>%
	# select cities with victim race
	filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX",
														 "Phoenix, AZ",
														 "Kansas City, MO",
														 "Tulsa, AL"))) %>%
	# change victim to numeric variable, race into factors
	mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
				# victim_race = if_else(victim_race == "White", "White", "Non-White"),
				 victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")) 
	
glm_baltimore <- homicide %>% 
	filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%
	glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
			data = .,
			family = binomial())
broom::tidy(glm_baltimore)
glm_baltimore
